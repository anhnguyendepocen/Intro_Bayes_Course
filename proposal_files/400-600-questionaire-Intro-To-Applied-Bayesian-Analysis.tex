\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{How will graduate students achieve deeper understanding of the material presented to the combined group?}

  Modeling/computational skill is obtained mostly through practice and effort. Graduate students will be expected to complete more exercises and exercises of greater difficulty. The selected text offers problems of three scaffolds - ``easy'', ``medium'', and ``hard''. The graduate students will often complete ``hard'' problems while undergraduate students will complete mostly ``easy'' and ``medium''. Graduate students will also be expected to master more of the mathematical details, whereas undergraduate understanding will be largely via computational reasoning.
  
\item \emph{How will graduate student assignments differ from those of the undergraduates in their nature or quantity?}

  See above for comments to this question regarding assignments. Midterms and exams will be graded more strictly with respect to correctness and clarity of exposition.

\item \emph{How will increased opportunities for independent study or for interaction with the instructor(s) be made available for graduate students?}

  Graduate student assignments will require additional independent reading/study, and the instructor will make time available specifically for graduate students during office hours. 
  
\item \emph{Discuss any synthesis experiences specifically for graduates?}

  None proposed.

\item \emph{Identify on the proposed syllabus the opportunities the graduates will have for work at a higher academic level.}

  The course syllabus discusses these aspects under the ``400/600 Students'' heading. 

\item \emph{Discuss how the work of graduate students will be evaluated differently from that of undergraduates by describing the criteria used in grading an undergraduate assignment versus those used in grading a graduate level assignment.}

  Evaluation on assignments will be largely the same (except that tasks will be more difficult as discussed above). Midterms and exams will be graded more strictly with respect to conceptual understanding, correctness, and clarity of exposition. 

\item \emph{How will graduates leave the course feeling that they have obtained greater academic value?}

The graduate students will feel that they obtained greater academic value as a result of the following measures: (i) Exposure to deeper level of material in homework exercises and exams, (ii) Different grading rules that emphasize the research component of the class, and (iii) Additional opportunities to interact with the instructor.
