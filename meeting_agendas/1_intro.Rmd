### Reciprocal interview

Questions for you:
1) What are your goals for the course?
2) What is your best outcome imagined for the course?
3) What is your worst outcome imagined for the course?
4) What is the most likely outcome imagined for the course?
5) What can I do to help you?

Questions for me/Diana?

### Take away

Assume good will among everyone here. **Ask Questions** and **Work Together** --- these are the most important reasons for class time.

## III. Course expectations and learning outcomes (20 min)

### Course structure

- Focus is on core Bayesian statistical ideas and techniques, both computational and analytic.
- Class will be cumulative, so keep up with the material and assignments!
- There will be both online instruction.
- I'll use a variety of instructional in-class activites: lecture, quick activities, more involved "lab" assignments, and student-led presentations.
- You should budget 9 hours a week for this class (2.5 in class and 6.5 outside). The bulk of your learning with happen outside of class!
